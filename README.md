# Crafting Code Magic, One Semicolon at a Time

### Hey there, code wizards and meme lovers! 👋 I'm an alumnus of Lakehead University, Canada, with a degree in Computer Science. I'm all about contributing to the rise of our robot overlords, and by that, I mean shaping our world through the power of computer science.

🚀 Now, I'm living the code dream at Viral Nation as a Backend Developer, where I wrestle with Typescript-based backends (don't worry, no JS code is harmed in the process).

🎓 I've had a Python-filled past, where I worked on a backend project for the Student Success Center at Lakehead University. The result? A shiny new Writing Assistant Tool, helping students level up their paraphrasing skills to avoid those pesky plagiarism goblins.

📲 In a parallel tech universe, I put on my superhero cape to build native iOS and Android apps for Infusionist. What was my mission? Helping nurses manage tasks related to infusions, because even healthcare heroes need some app magic.

🌿 I'm also on a quest to conquer new tech territories, currently sharpening my DevOps, Flask, and React.js swords to slay the ever-evolving dragon of technological advancement.

🤝 Got a cool project with Node.js, Android, Kotlin, or Python-based backends in mind? Let's team up! Together, we can create the Avengers of the tech world.

📈 Before all this, I played a part in crafting 'Rivi', an AI-based travel planner app. It was like giving a smart assistant to your adventurous spirit, revolutionizing the way we plan our escapades.

In the immortal words of Mario, "Let's-a go!" Being a software developer isn't just my 9-to-5, it's the mushroom power to my Super Mario. I'm here to change the game, one line of code at a time, and I'm always eager to team up with people who share the same vision. If that's you, let's create our version of the code-filled, fun, meme-tastic Mushroom Kingdom. Here's to coding a fun future together! 🍻
